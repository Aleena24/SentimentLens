SentimentLens
 Project Description:  SentimentLens is an advanced sentiment analysis API designed to process customer reviews and extract meaningful insights using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). Developed using Python and Flask, the API accepts both CSV and XLSX files, efficiently parsing customer reviews for analysis. By leveraging the Groq API, SentimentLens performs a detailed sentiment evaluation, classifying the reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories.  The API responds with a structured JSON output, offering a clear breakdown of sentiment scores. Built with a focus on error handling and robustness, SentimentLens ensures smooth functionality even in cases of file format inconsistencies or API issues.  The project is documented extensively, providing insights into the development process, potential improvements, and practical examples of usage, making it a reliable tool for businesses seeking to understand customer sentiment.
